In this module, you will use the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Console to create and deploy a web application.
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a compute service that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications in AWS 
without having to worry about the infrastructure that runs them.
You will use the Create web app wizard to create an application and launch an environment with the AWS resources needed to run your application. 
In subsequent modules you will be using this environment and your continuous delivery pipeline to deploy the Hello World! web app created in Module 1.
